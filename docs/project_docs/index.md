# Welcome to the fitness-tracker

## Overview

Full stack fitness tracking application using TinyDB and FastAPI.
Add weight-training logs continuously to db.json and query the data through the browser.
Visually inspect your progression through dates and exercises

### Getting Started

To get started, follow the instructions in the examples section.

## Features

- FastAPI app "Fitness-Tracker", with TinyDB backend, exposed through Docker container
- Program logging (Located in folder: logs)
- Plotting with the Seaborn library. Example figures [here](docs/project_docs/img)
- Documentation, auto-generated by Sphinx and hosted on [readthedocs](https://fitness-tracker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
- Multiple unit test suites (Pytest)
- BDD (Behavior Driven Development, using the Behave framework)
- Multiple GitHub Actions workflows
- Data quality validation (Pydantic, Great Expections)
- Package dependency management (Poetry)
- KPI tracking: 1-Rep-Max estimation (Epley and Brzycki formulas)
- Realistic workout data simulation (with naturally progressing trend over time)
- Catalogue of musclegroups, corresponding exercises and suggested weight ranges (for simulations)

### TODO

- Fix OpenAPI wf
- add quantitative flexibility measurements / estimations
- quality control for TS and JS
- timezone check; check stated timezone in workout logs are consistent with the definition:
      CEST spans from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.
      start by checking that workout logs timezone data for November -> February are not CEST
