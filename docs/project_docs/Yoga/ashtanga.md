# Ashtanga

Ashtanga Yoga is a traditional, dynamic, and physically demanding form of yoga rooted in ancient Indian teachings. It follows a specific sequence of postures linked with breath (vinyasa), creating a flowing and meditative practice. Ashtanga is typically practiced six days a week, traditionally in the morning on an empty stomach, and includes five daily breathing techniques (pranayama) after asana practice.

There are six series in the Ashtanga system:

1. Primary Series (Yoga Chikitsa) – "Yoga Therapy"
2. Intermediate Series (Nadi Shodhana) – "Nerve Purification"
3. Advanced A (Sthira Bhaga) – "Divine Stability"
4. Advanced B, C, D – progressively more advanced

Most practitioners focus on the Primary and Intermediate Series unless they are very experienced or have been authorized to proceed further.

Tips for Practicing Ashtanga

- Breath: Keep steady, rhythmic breathing throughout (ujjayi breath).
- Gaze (Drishti): Each posture has a specific gaze point.
- Bandhas: Engage Mula Bandha (root lock) and Uddiyana Bandha (abdominal lock).
- Consistency: Practice daily if possible, ideally at the same time.
- Progression: Don’t rush; move to the next pose only when ready.
- Teacher Guidance: Especially important early on to ensure correct alignment and progression.
