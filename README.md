## Intro

Full stack fitness tracking application using TinyDB and FastAPI.
Add weight-training logs continuously to db.json and query the data through the browser.
Visually inspect your progression through dates and exercises

## Architecture Diagram

## Getting started

First, clone the project:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/TheNewThinkTank/Fitness-Tracker.git`

### Upload your workouts

- Add your workout log to the `data` folder under the correct workout date
- Edit `src/orchestration/real_flow.sh`: Specify the `WORKOUT_DATE` and `TRAINING_PROGRAM` values
- Execute `bash src/orchestration/real_flow.sh` which will insert your log(s) into the TinyDB database

### Analyze your data

Run FastAPI web app with Docker from CLI:
`docker-compose up`<br>
then visit the URL: http://localhost:8080/docs

Alternatively,

```BASH
docker build -t ftimage .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name ftcontainer ftimage
```

### Update docs

```BASH
cd docs
make clean
sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../src
make html
```
