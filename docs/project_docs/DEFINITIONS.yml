  The ability of a muscle or muscle group to lengthen passively through a range of motion
  Flexibility exercises involve stretching muscles to improve their elasticity and range of motion.
Strength Training: |
  A type of physical exercise specializing in the use of resistance to induce muscular contraction,
  which builds strength, anaerobic endurance, and muscle size.
Resistance Training: |
  A form of exercise that involves using resistance to induce muscular contraction,
  which builds strength, endurance, and muscle size.
Cardio: |
  Short for cardiovascular exercise, it refers to any exercise that raises your heart rate.
  This includes activities like running, cycling, swimming, and brisk walking.
Aerobic Exercise: |
  Physical exercise of low to moderate intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process.
  It is characterized by the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise.
Anaerobic Exercise: |
  Physical exercise of high intensity that relies on energy sources stored in the muscles,
  rather than on oxygen from breathing.
Calisthenics: |
  A form of exercise consisting of a variety of movements that do not require weights or equipment.
  These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment,
  focusing on using one's body weight for resistance.
Bodyweight Training: |
  A form of strength training that uses the individual's own weight to provide resistance against gravity.
  It includes exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, squats, and lunges,
  and can be performed anywhere without the need for equipment.
Progressive Overload: |
  A fundamental principle of strength training that involves gradually increasing the amount of weight or resistance
  used in exercises over time to stimulate muscle growth and strength gains.
Periodization: |
  A systematic approach to training that involves varying the intensity, volume, and type of exercise
  over specific periods to optimize performance and recovery.
Deload: |
  A planned reduction in training volume or intensity to allow for recovery and adaptation.
  It typically involves lighter weights or reduced workout frequency for a short period.
Active Recovery: |
  Low-intensity exercise performed after a workout or on rest days to promote recovery,
  such as walking, light cycling, or stretching.
Warm-Up: |
  A preparatory phase before exercise that involves light physical activity to increase heart rate,
  warm up the muscles, and prepare the body for more intense activity.
Cool Down: |
  A post-exercise phase that involves light physical activity and stretching to help the body recover,
  lower heart rate, and prevent stiffness.
Workout Split: |
  A training routine that divides workouts into different muscle groups or movement patterns,
  allowing for focused training on specific areas of the body on different days.
Full-Body Workout: |
  A training session that targets all major muscle groups in a single workout,
  often involving compound exercises that engage multiple muscles simultaneously.
Compound Exercises: |
  Exercises that involve multiple joints and muscle groups,
  such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups.
Isolation Exercises: |
  Exercises that target a specific muscle group and involve only one joint,
  such as bicep curls, tricep extensions, and leg curls.
Warm-Up Sets: |
  Lighter sets performed before the main workout sets to prepare the muscles and joints for heavier loads
  and to reduce the risk of injury.
Cool-Down Sets: |
  Lighter sets or exercises performed after the main workout to help the body transition back to a resting state,
  promote recovery, and reduce muscle soreness.
Rest Days: |
  Days designated for recovery from intense training, allowing the body to repair and adapt.
  Rest days are crucial for preventing overtraining and reducing the risk of injury.
Cross-Training: |
  Engaging in different types of exercise or sports to improve overall fitness,
  prevent boredom, and reduce the risk of injury from repetitive movements.
Functional Training: |
  A type of training that focuses on exercises that mimic everyday movements,
  improving overall strength, balance, coordination, and flexibility for daily activities.
Endurance Training: |
  A type of training that focuses on improving the body's ability to sustain prolonged physical activity,
  enhancing cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, and overall stamina.
Strength Endurance: |
  The ability of a muscle or group of muscles to perform repeated contractions over an extended period,
  combining both strength and endurance training principles.
Hypertrophy: |
  The increase in the size of skeletal muscle fibers through resistance training,
  typically achieved through moderate to high volume training with moderate weights.
Power Training: |
  A type of training that focuses on developing explosive strength and speed,
  often involving high-intensity, low-repetition exercises like Olympic lifts, plyometrics,
  and sprinting drills.
Agility Training: |
  A type of training that focuses on improving quickness, coordination, and balance,
  often involving drills that require rapid changes in direction and speed.
Balance Training: |
  Exercises designed to improve stability and control of the body's position,
  often involving single-leg movements, stability balls, or balance boards.
Core Stability: |
  The ability to maintain control of the body's position and movement through the core muscles,
  which include the abdominal muscles, lower back, hips, and pelvis.
Mobility Drills: |
  Specific exercises designed to improve joint range of motion and flexibility,
  often involving dynamic movements, stretching, and foam rolling.
Flexibility Training: |
  A type of training that focuses on improving the elasticity and length of muscles,
  often involving static stretching, dynamic stretching, and mobility exercises.
Recovery: |
  The process of allowing the body to heal and adapt after physical exertion,
  which can include rest, nutrition, hydration, and active recovery techniques.
Nutrition: |
  The process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth,
  including macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).
Hydration: |
  The process of maintaining adequate fluid balance in the body,
  which is essential for optimal performance, recovery, and overall health.
Supplementation: |
  The use of dietary supplements to enhance performance, recovery, or overall health,
  which can include protein powders, vitamins, minerals, and other performance-enhancing substances.
